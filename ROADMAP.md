# Mollie & Magento 2 Roadmap

This is an overview of the features we are looking to work on over the next few months and an overview of features that are ready for beta testing.

This document is created in collaboration with the merchants, agencies, the Mollie, and the Magmodules team. It will evolve as priorities grow and shift. Please feel free as an agency, merchant, or developer to file issues on this repository if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## What we're working on / what is on our backlog

*   **Refactor the order processing**  
    Break this code into small parts using Magento's architecture to improve testing, size, and readability.  
    Â 
*   **Refactor order lines**  
    Move to separate classes as well to improve the way of calculation, testing, and readability.
